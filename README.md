## Features

### Integration with multiple video services

To use the plugin, you must have a subscription to the desired service.

- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com)

### Word and full subtitle translation

Simply move the cursor over the word you want to translate. The video will automatically pause and resume when you move the cursor away from the subtitles.  
In the translation pop-up for the word, you can see alternative translations and how often they are used.
Click the subtitles to translate the entire phrase.

### Export words to learning services

The list of services will be extended in response to user requests.

**Now supported:**

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/),
- [LinguaLeo](https://lingualeo.com),
- [Puzzle English](https://puzzle-english.com)

To export, you'll need to be logged in to the service you want to use (make sure it's the same browser). Then select the service you want to use in the extension settings.

Rewind to the previous sentence by pressing ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (left arrow).  
Rewind to the next sentence by pressing ‚û°Ô∏è (right arrow).
Repeat the current subtitle ‚¨á (down arrow).

Rewind only works if the next/previous sentence is less than 5 seconds apart from the current sentence. Otherwise it'll rewinds 5 seconds.  
To force rewinding to the next/previous sentence use `alt (option for macOS) + arrow button`.
