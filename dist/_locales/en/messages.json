    "message":"'L10n' refers to 'Localization' - 'L' an 'n' are obvious, and 10 comes from the number of letters between those two.  It is the process/whatever of displaying something in the language of choice.  It uses 'I18n', 'Internationalization', which refers to the tools / framework supporting L10n.  I.e., something is internationalized if it has I18n support, and can be localized.  Something is localized for you if it is in your language / dialect."
    ,"description":"introduce the basic idea."
  }
  ,"l10nProd": {
    "message":"You <strong>are</strong> planning to allow localization, right?  You have <em>no idea</em> who will be using your extension!  You have no idea who will be translating it!  At least support the basics, it's not hard, and having the framework in place will let you transition much more easily later on."

  ,"l10nSecondParagraph": {
    "message":"If you need more complex localization, you can also define <strong>data-l10n-args</strong>.  This should contain <span class='code'>$containerType$</span> filled with <span class='code'>$dataType$</span>, which will be passed into Chrome's i18n API as <span class='code'>$functionArgs$</span>.  In fact, this paragraph does just that, and wraps the args in mono-space font.  Easy!"
